Password Reset Email Issues

If you’re having trouble with the password reset email, try these tips to help you complete the process:

Check your junk mail folder, because Square’s emails are occasionally sorted out by spam filters.
Double-check that the email address you entered into the password reset field is the same email used to access your Square account.
If you see the message “This token has been used”, visit square.com/dashboard from your browser to confirm you are signed out of the dashboard. Reset your password again.
