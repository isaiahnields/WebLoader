Track Payments by Device
To distinguish between multiple devices accepting payments with one Square account, give a unique name to each mobile device. You can do this with both Android and iOS devices. With an iPad, you can also track devices accepting payments with device codes.

To name an Android device:

From the Square app, access your in-app settings by tapping: or the down arrow at the top of the Square Register: 
Tap Settings > Device Name.
Enter a device name. 
To name an iOS device:

Open Settings on your device.
Tap General > About > Name.
Enter a device name. 
After assigning a device name, view which device accepted each payment by downloading your transactions spreadsheet from your online Square Dashboard. 

To view payments accepted on iPads that have been paired to your business by a device code:

Visit Sales Summary in your online Square Dashboard > click Advanced Options > filter by Device.
Check the box next to the device(s) you’d like to view.
Click Export. 
Operating a business with multiple locations is easier than ever. Once you have created more than one location you’ll be able to track your sales by date, time, location and employee.
