Employee Management Subscriptions

When you sign up for Square, you start with a free single administrator account. With a single administrator account, your only fee comes from processing payment cards at our standard card processing rates, and any other additional services you choose. If you need to create additional employees, you can subscribe to Employee Management, at $5 per employee, from your online Square Dashboard.

Your subscription comes with a 30-day free trial. After your 30-day trial, you’ll be charged a prorated amount for the remainder of the current month for each saved employee. Moving forward, Square will charge you on the first of each month for every active employee. To downgrade your subscription, just deactivate any unused employees. You can reactivate employees at any time.
